The current release of pyodbc (4.0.32) does not have pre-built wheel files for Python 3.10. The easiest way to get it installed at the moment is to download the appropriate wheel from

https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyodbc

and then install it. For example, if you are running 64-bit Python then you would download the 64-bit wheel and use

pip install pyodbc‑4.0.32‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl

I have already downloade the whl file and it is included in the repository.
